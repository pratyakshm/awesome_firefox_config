# ℹ️ Introduction

This is my personal user.js that I use across my Windows devices. It is a modified version of [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). The differences between this and arkenfox's user.js are not documented. If you want to learn what this config does, peek into the user.js file itself since it has all the necessary comments that you need to educate yourself.


## ➕ Things added:

- Smooth scrolling derived from [AveYo/fox](https://github.com/AveYo/fox/blob/main/Natural%20Smooth%20Scrolling%20for%20user.js).

- Mica material powered by [MicaForEveryone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) with CSS from [QNetITQ/WaveFox](https://github.com/QNetITQ/WaveFox).
